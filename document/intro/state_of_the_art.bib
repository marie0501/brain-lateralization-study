	abstract = {We introduce functional MRI methods for estimating the neuronal population receptive field (pRF). These methods build on conventional visual field mapping that measures responses to ring and wedge patterns shown at a series of visual field locations and estimates the single position in the visual field that produces the largest response. The new method computes a model of the population receptive field from responses to a wide range of stimuli and estimates the visual field map as well as other neuronal population properties, such as receptive field size and laterality. The visual field maps obtained with the pRF method are more accurate than those obtained using conventional visual field mapping, and we trace with high precision the visual field maps to the center of the foveal representation. We report quantitative estimates of pRF size in medial, lateral and ventral occipital regions of human visual cortex. Also, we quantify the amount of input from ipsi- and contralateral visual fields. The human pRF size estimates in V1-V3 agree well with electrophysiological receptive field measurements at a range of eccentricities in corresponding locations within monkey and human visual field maps. The pRF method is non-invasive and can be applied to a wide range of conditions when it is useful to link fMRI signals in the visual pathways to neuronal receptive fields.},

One limit to the precision of his result, and the mapping of anatomy to retinotopy generally, is the substantial individual variation in the size [2, 3], volumetric position [4], and cortical magniﬁcation [5] of area V1. When viewed within the context of the curvature of the cortical surface, however, the boundaries of striate cortex fall at a consistent location across individuals [6]. We asked whether the surface topology of the human brain can be used to accurately predict the internal, retinotopic function of striate cortex as well. We used fMRI to measure polar angle and eccentricity in 25 participants and combined their maps within a left-right, transform-symmetric representation of the cortical surface [7]. These data were then ﬁt using a deterministic, algebraic model of visual-ﬁeld representation [8]. We found that an anatomical image alone can be used to predict the retinotopic organization of striate cortex for an individual with accuracy equivalent to 10–25 min of functional mapping. This indicates tight developmental linkage of structure and function within a primary, sensory cortical area.},

Typically, maps are obtained by voxel-wise analysis of fMRI data. This method, while useful, maps only a portion of the visual field and is limited by measurement noise and subjective assessment of boundaries. We developed a novel Bayesian mapping approach which combines observation–a subject’s retinotopic measurements from small amounts of fMRI time–with a prior–a learned retinotopic atlas. This process automatically draws areal boundaries, corrects discontinuities in the measured maps, and predicts validation data more accurately than an atlas alone or independent datasets alone. This new method can be used to improve the accuracy of retinotopic mapping, to analyze large fMRI datasets automatically, and to quantify differences in map properties as a function of health, development and natural variation between individuals.},

In this study, we tested linear spatial summation of population responses using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI. We measured BOLD responses to a systematic set of contrast patterns and discovered systematic deviation from linearity: the data are more accurately explained by a model in which a compressive static nonlinearity is applied after linear spatial summation. We found that the nonlinearity is present in early visual areas (e.g., V1, V2) and grows more pronounced in relatively anterior extrastriate areas (e.g., LO-2, VO-2). We then analyzed the effect of compressive spatial summation in terms of changes in the position and size of a viewed object. Compressive spatial summation is consistent with tolerance to changes in position and size, an important characteristic of object representation.},

This work was aimed at investigating the mechanisms by which selective attention to spatial frequency (SF) mediates global and local perception in general and how these perceptual levels are integrated with the shapes that deﬁne them. The experiments demonstrate that attention to global and local aspects of a hierarchical display biases the ﬂexible selection of relatively lower and relatively higher SFs during image processing. Additionally, attentional selection of SF allows for the shapes in a hierarchical display to be integrated with the level (global/local) at which they occur. The studies reviewed here provide strong evidence that the ﬂexible, top-down selection of low-level SF channels mediates the perception of global and local elements of visual displays. The studies also support a hemisphere asymmetry in this process, with right hemisphere functions biased toward global perception and left hemisphere functions biased toward local.},

The second approach is multivariate pattern classification, in which the researcher collects the same type of data as in the tuning-curve approach but uses these data to train a statistical classifier that attempts to predict the dimension of interest from measured responses.

	abstract = {Human neuroimaging experiments typically localize motion-selective cortex (MT+) by contrasting responses to stationary and moving stimuli. It has long been suspected that MT+, located on the lateral surface at the temporal–occipital (TO) boundary, contains several distinct visual field maps, although only one coarse map has been measured. Using a novel functional MRI model–based method we identified two maps—TO-1 and TO-2—and measured population receptive field (pRF) sizes within these maps. The angular representation of the first map, TO-1, has a lower vertical meridian on its posterior side at the boundary with the lateral–occipital cortex (i.e., the LO-2 portion). The angular representation continues through horizontal to the upper vertical meridian at the boundary with the second map, TO-2. The TO-2 angle map reverses from upper to lower visual field at increasingly anterior positions. The TO maps share a parallel eccentricity map in which center-to-periphery is represented in the ventral-to-dorsal direction; both maps have an expanded foveal representation. There is a progressive increase in the pRF size from V1/2/3 to LO-1/2 and TO-1/2, with the largest pRF sizes in TO-2. Further, within each map the pRF size increases as a function of eccentricity. The visual field coverage of both maps extends into the ipsilateral visual field, with larger sensitivity to peripheral ipsilateral stimuli in TO-2 than that in TO-1. The TO maps provide a functional segmentation of human motion-sensitive cortex that enables a more complete characterization of processing in human motion-selective cortex.},

	abstract = {Neurons within early visual cortex are selective for basic image statistics, including spatial frequency. However, these neurons are thought to act as band-pass filters, with the window of spatial frequency sensitivity varying across the visual field and across visual areas. Although a handful of previous functional (f)MRI studies have examined human spatial frequency sensitivity using conventional designs and analysis methods, these measurements are time consuming and fail to capture the precision of spatial frequency tuning (bandwidth). In this study, we introduce a model-driven approach to fMRI analyses that allows for fast and efficient estimation of population spatial frequency tuning (pSFT) for individual voxels. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses within early visual cortex were acquired while subjects viewed a series of full-field stimuli that swept through a large range of spatial frequency content. Each stimulus was generated by band-pass filtering white noise with a central frequency that changed periodically between a minimum of 0.5 cycles/degree (cpd) and a maximum of 12 cpd. To estimate the underlying frequency tuning of each voxel, we assumed a log-Gaussian pSFT and optimized the parameters of this function by comparing our model output against the measured BOLD time series. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that an increase in eccentricity within each visual area is accompanied by a drop in the peak spatial frequency of the pSFT. Moreover, we found that pSFT bandwidth depends on eccentricity and is correlated with the pSFT peak; populations with lower peaks possess broader bandwidths in logarithmic scale, whereas in linear scale this relationship is reversed.
            NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Spatial frequency selectivity is a hallmark property of early visuocortical neurons, and mapping these sensitivities gives us crucial insight into the hierarchical organization of information within visual areas. Due to technical obstacles, we lack a comprehensive picture of the properties of this sensitivity in humans. Here, we introduce a new method, coined population spatial frequency tuning mapping, which circumvents the limitations of the conventional neuroimaging methods, yielding a fuller visuocortical map of spatial frequency sensitivity.},

Here we used functional MRI and population receptive field (pRF) analysis to test whether the response selectivity of human visual cortex is atypical in individuals with high-functioning ASDs compared with neurotypical, demographically matched controls. For each voxel, we fitted a pRF model to fMRI signals measured while participants viewed flickering bar stimuli traversing the visual field. In most extrastriate regions, perifoveal pRFs were larger in the ASD group than in controls. We observed no differences in V1 or V3A. Differences in the hemodynamic response function, eye movements, or increased measurement noise could not account for these results; individuals with ASDs showed stronger, more reliable responses to visual stimulation. Interestingly, pRF sizes also correlated with individual differences in autistic traits but there were no correlations with behavioral measures of visual processing. Our findings thus suggest that visual cortex in ASDs is not characterized by sharper spatial selectivity. Instead, we speculate that visual cortical function in ASDs may be characterized by extrastriate cortical hyperexcitability or differential attentional deployment.},

	abstract = {The spatial sensitivity of the human visual system depends on stimulus color: achromatic gratings can be resolved at relatively high spatial frequencies while sensitivity to isoluminant color contrast tends to be more low-pass. Models of early spatial vision often assume that the receptive ﬁeld size of pattern-sensitive neurons is correlated with their spatial frequency sensitivity - larger receptive ﬁelds are typically associated with lower optimal spatial frequency. A strong prediction of this model is that neurons coding isoluminant chromatic patterns should have, on average, a larger receptive ﬁeld size than neurons sensitive to achromatic patterns. Here, we test this assumption using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We show that while spatial frequency sensitivity depends on chromaticity in the manner predicted by behavioral measurements, population receptive ﬁeld (pRF) size measurements show no such dependency. At any given eccentricity, the mean pRF size for neuronal populations driven by luminance, opponent red/green and S-cone isolating contrast, are identical. Changes in pRF size (for example, an increase with eccentricity and visual area hierarchy) are also identical across the three chromatic conditions. These results suggest that fMRI measurements of receptive ﬁeld size and spatial resolution can be decoupled under some circumstances - potentially reﬂecting a fundamental dissociation between these parameters at the level of neuronal populations.},

The advent of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a non-invasive, spatially-resolved technique for measuring brain activity, provided a wealth of data about human retinotopic maps. Just as there are differences amongst non-human primate maps, the human maps have their own unique properties. Many human maps can be measured reliably in individual subjects during experimental sessions lasting less than an hour. The efﬁciency of the measurements and the relatively large amplitude of functional MRI signals in visual cortex make it possible to develop quantitative models of functional responses within speciﬁc maps in individual subjects. During this last quartercentury, there has also been signiﬁcant progress in measuring properties of the human brain at a range of length and time scales, including white matter pathways, macroscopic properties of gray and white matter, and cellular and molecular tissue properties. We hope the next 25 years will see a great deal of work that aims to integrate these data by modeling the network of visual signals. We do not know what such theories will look like, but the characterization of human retinotopic maps from the last 25 years is likely to be an important part of future ideas about visual computations.},

	abstract = {Human medial occipital cortex comprises multiple visual areas, each with a distinct retinotopic representation of visual environment. We measured spatial frequency (SF) tuning curves with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found consistent differences between these areas. Areas V1, V2, VP, V3, V4v, and V3A were all band-pass tuned, with progressively lower SF optima in V1, V2, and V3A. In VP and V3, the SF optima were similar to optima in V2, whereas V4v showed more individual variation and scattered SF representations on the cortical surface. Area V5+ showed low-pass SF tuning. In each area, the SF optimum declined with increasing eccentricity. After accounting for the cortical magniﬁcation, the cortical extent of the optimal spatial wavelengths was approximately constant across eccentricity in V1, which suggests an anatomical constraint for the optimal SF, and this extent is actually comparable to the extent of horizontal connections within primate V1. The optimal spatial wavelengths in the visual ﬁeld are also of similar extent to the spatial summation ﬁelds of macaque V1. The progressive decline in the SF tuning from V1 to V2 and V3A is compatible with the view that these areas represent visual information at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is the latest stage of the ventral ‘‘what’’ visual pathway, which is thought to code the identity of a stimulus regardless of its position or size [1, 2]. Surprisingly, recent studies show that position information can be decoded from VTC [3–5]. However, the computational mechanisms by which spatial information is encoded in VTC are unknown. Furthermore, how attention inﬂuences spatial representations in human VTC is also unknown because the effect of attention on spatial representations has only been examined in the dorsal ‘‘where’’ visual pathway [6–10]. Here, we ﬁll these signiﬁcant gaps in knowledge using an approach that combines functional magnetic resonance imaging and sophisticated computational methods. We ﬁrst develop a population receptive ﬁeld (pRF) model [11, 12] of spatial responses in human VTC. Consisting of spatial summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity, this model accurately predicts responses of individual voxels to stimuli at any position and size, explains how spatial information is encoded, and reveals a functional hierarchy in VTC. We then manipulate attention and use our model to decipher the effects of attention. We ﬁnd that attention to the stimulus systematically and selectively modulates responses in VTC, but not early visual areas. Locally, attention increases eccentricity, size, and gain of individual pRFs, thereby increasing position tolerance. However, globally, these effects reduce uncertainty regarding stimulus location and actually increase position sensitivity of distributed responses across VTC. These results demonstrate that attention actively shapes and enhances spatial representations in the ventral visual pathway.},

	abstract = {Antagonistic center–surround conﬁgurations are a central organizational principle of our visual system. In visual cortex, stimulation outside the classical receptive ﬁeld can decrease neural activity and also decrease functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signal amplitudes. Decreased fMRI amplitudes below baseline—0\% contrast—are often referred to as “negative” responses. Using neural model-based fMRI data analyses, we can estimate the region of visual space to which each cortical location responds, i.e., the population receptive ﬁeld (pRF). Current models of the pRF do not account for a center–surround organization or negative fMRI responses. Here, we extend the pRF model by adding surround suppression. Where the conventional model uses a circular symmetric Gaussian function to describe the pRF, the new model uses a circular symmetric difference-of-Gaussians (DoG) function. The DoG model allows the pRF analysis to capture fMRI signals below baseline and surround suppression. Comparing the ﬁts of the models, an increased variance explained is found for the DoG model. This improvement was predominantly present in V1/2/3 and decreased in later visual areas. The improvement of the ﬁts was particularly striking in the parts of the fMRI signal below baseline. Estimates for the surround size of the pRF show an increase with eccentricity and over visual areas V1/2/3. For the suppression index, which is based on the ratio between the volumes of both Gaussians, we show a decrease over visual areas V1 and V2. Using non-invasive fMRI techniques, this method gives the possibility to examine assumptions about center–surround receptive ﬁelds in human subjects.},
